"""
Merge Strings Alternately â€” Problem Description

Given two strings word1 and word2, merge them by adding letters in alternating
order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the
additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Complexity:
- Time: O(n + m)
- Space: O(1) extra space (output excluded)
