"""
Container With Most Water â€” Problem Description

Given n non-negative integers `height[i]` where each represents a vertical line at
index i with height `height[i]`, find two lines that together with the x-axis form
a container that holds the most water. Return the maximum amount of water it can store.

Approach (Two Pointers, Tag: two pointers):
- Use two pointers at the ends of the array.
- At each step, compute area = (right_index - left_index) * min(height[left], height[right]).
- Move the pointer at the shorter line inward to potentially find a taller boundary.

Example:
  Input:  height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
  Output: 49
