# Container With Most Water (Two Pointers)

- Tag: two pointers
- Intuition: the area is width Ã— min(height_left, height_right); the shorter side limits the area.
- Approach: start two pointers at the ends, compute area each step, move the shorter side inward to search for a taller boundary while width shrinks.
- Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) extra space
